# dream-saviour

  Dream-saviour is a simple web application to help you record your dreams. It is often frustrating to sit up in bed in order to write down your dreams, so dream-saviour allows you to record your dreams using your voice immediately after you wake up--without even moving! In fact, since you do not move, you will be more able to recall your dreams, and your chances of a wake-iniatied lucid dream will increase. 

  Ensure that your microphone or computer is as close to you as possible and turn up the gain as much as you can. Remember to be patient and you will get better at using the voice recognition tool. To get started  click on the green button in the upper right corner to clone or download the project to your preffered location. If you are unfamiliar with git, it may be better to download and extract the zip file. Then open a terminal, go to the directory that you chose, and run the command 
"python -m SimpleHTTPServer" and press enter. Finally open google chrome browser and navigate to "localhost:8000/public". 

Happy awakenings!
