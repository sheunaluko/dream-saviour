It is often frustrating to sit up in bed in order to write down your dream, so dream-saviour allows you to record your dreams using your voice immediately after you wake up--without even moving! In fact, since you do not move, you will be more able to recall your dreams, and your chances of a wake-iniatied lucid dream will increase.

Finally open google chrome browser and navigate to "localhost:8000/public".
